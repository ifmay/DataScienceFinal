### Project Description
In this project, we aim to predict flight delays based on various flight-related attributes using
three classification algorithms: Naive Bayes (dt), Decision Tree, and Random Forest. Flight delays are 
a critical concern in aviation, impacting passengers, airlines, and airport operations necessitating 
the development of reliable predictive models to mitigate their effects. Accurate delay predictions 
can help airlines optimize schedules, enhance passenger experiences, and improve overall operational efficiency. 

### Instructions to Run the Project:
  - Step 1: Clone the repo
  - Step 2: Press 'Run All' on the report.ipynb file. This will generate the appropriate graphs, classifiers
          and performance metrics.
    
### Organization
  - mysklearn contains all files necessary for creating the classifiers used.
  - graph_utils.py contains helper function to help produce the graphs used.
  - The input_data folder contains the initial dataset (flights.csv) of 300,000 instances from Kaggle,
  - along with the final dataset used for classification (balanced_flights.csv).
  - The report.ipynb file is the primary file used for predictions and analysis.
