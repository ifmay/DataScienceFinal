Flight delays are a critical concern in aviation, impacting passengers, airlines, and airport operations.
In this project, we aim to predict flight delays based on various flight-related attributes using
three classification algorithms: Naive Bayes (dt), Decision Tree, and Random Forest.  

To Run the Project:
  Step 1: Clone the repo
  Step 2: Press 'Run All' on the report.ipynb file. This will generate the appropriate graphs, classifiers
          and performance metrics.

Organization:
  mysklearn contains all files necessary for creating the classifiers used.
  graph_utils.py contains helper function to help produce the graphs used.
  The input_data folder contains the initial dataset (flights.csv) of 300,000 instances from Kaggle,
  along with the final dataset used for classification (balanced_flights.csv).
  The report.ipynb file is the primary file used for predictions and analysis.
